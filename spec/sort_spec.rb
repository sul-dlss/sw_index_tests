  # these are TODO  
  Scenario: Spaces should be significant
  Scenario: Case / Capitalization should have no effect on sorting
  Scenario: Punctuation should not affect sorting
  Scenario: Subscripts should be sorted properly
  # super scripts;  what about $, %, etc.

  Scenario: Letters with and without diacritics should be interfiled
    # TODO:  diacritics in first character;  subsequent characters  
  Scenario: Polish L should sort properly
  Scenario: Znaks, hard and soft, should be ignored for sorting
    # More information needed about znaks: is this a character?  a diacritic?  Should any occurrence be ignored?

  Scenario: Æ and AE should be interfiled
    And I go to the home page
    When I fill in "q" with "Æon"
    And I press "search"
    And I select "title" from "sort"
    And I press "sort_submit"
    Then I should get ckey 6628532 before ckey 4647437
    Then I should get ckey 6197318 before ckey 4647437

  Scenario: Chinese - traditional and simplified characters should be sorted together
  Scenario: Japanese - old and new characters should sort together?
  Scenario: Korean - something about spaces vs. no space (?)
  Scenario: Hebrew alif and ayn should be ignored for sorting
    # TODO:  as first character only, or as any character?
    # TODO:  transliteration vs. hebrew script ... 


  Scenario: Combination of non-filing characters and diacritics in first character should sort properly.
     # Etude,   another example from vitus in email week of 4/27

  Scenario: Non-filing indicators should be ignored for sorting.
   # TODO: maybe someday autodetect non-filing chars that aren't accommodated in the marc record
